## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

I'm usually more of a flexbox  guy, so I'm new to using grid. I can see that it has a lot to offer, and is understandably a standard in layour creation. I'd like to familiarize myself with it a little more and become a more fluent grid user.
